Overview

EDB Backup and Recovery Manager (Barman) is a backup and recovery solution for PostgreSQL. It supports a wide variety of architectures, from a two-node PostgreSQL cluster in the same data center, to geographically-redundant multi-node clusters that span data center regions and availability zones.

You can export Barman backups to multiple destinations, including tape, Amazon S3, Google Cloud, or Azure Blob Storage.
