# Contributing to Barman

[EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/) has a team of software engineers, architects, database administrators, system administrators, QA engineers, developers and managers that dedicate their time and expertise to improve Barman's code. 

We adopt lean and agile methodologies for software development, and we believe in the *devops* culture that allowed us to implement rigorous testing procedures through cross-functional collaboration. 

Every Barman commit is the contribution of multiple individuals, at different stages of the production pipeline.
