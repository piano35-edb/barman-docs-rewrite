Contributing to Barman
EnterpriseDB has a team of software engineers, architects, database administrators, system administrators, QA engineers, developers and managers that dedicate their time and expertise to improve Barman's code. We adopt lean and agile methodologies for software development, and we believe in the devops culture that allowed us to implement rigorous testing procedures through cross-functional collaboration. Every Barman commit is the contribution of multiple individuals, at different stages of the production pipeline.

Even though this is our preferred way of developing Barman, we gladly accept patches from external developers, as long as:

user documentation (tutorial and man pages) is provided.
source code is properly documented and contains relevant comments.
code supplied is covered by unit tests.
no unrelated feature is compromised or broken.
source code is rebased on the current master branch.
commits and pull requests are limited to a single feature (multi-feature patches are hard to test and review).
changes to the user interface are discussed beforehand with EnterpriseDB.
We also require that any contributions provide a copyright assignment and a disclaimer of any work-for-hire ownership claims from the employer of the developer.

You can use GitHub's pull requests system for this purpose.
